      "image_analysis": "### **Style**:  \nThe image embodies a **minimalist, modern, and bold aesthetic**. Stripped of ornamentation, it focuses on essential elements: a single, solid blue square set against a clean white background. This simplicity prioritizes color and form, making it a study in \"less is more\" design—ideal for contexts where clarity and impact are key.  \n\n\n### **Colors**:  \nThe palette is intentionally restrained yet striking, centered on two core hues:  \n- **Primary Color**: A rich, saturated blue (likely a mid-to-deep tone, though specifics depend on exact shade). Blue here feels intentional and dominant, evoking a sense of depth without overwhelming.  \n- **Neutral Background**: Crisp, bright white. This neutral acts as a \"blank canvas,\" amplifying the blue’s vibrancy through high contrast.  \n\nThe limited palette—just blue and white—creates a sense of cohesion and focus, proving that even two colors can deliver strong visual punch when balanced thoughtfully.  \n\n\n### **Mood**:  \nThe color combination elicits a mood that is **calm, trustworthy, and quietly confident**. Blue, universally associated with stability, trust, and serenity, grounds the design in approachability, while its saturation adds a subtle boldness (avoiding passivity). The white background reinforces a feeling of cleanliness, openness, and clarity, preventing the blue from feeling heavy.  \n\nTogether, the mood is balanced: serene yet purposeful, making it versatile for contexts ranging from branding (conveying reliability) to interior design (creating a tranquil focal point) or digital interfaces (ensuring readability and focus).  \n\n\n### **Inspiration Takeaway**:  \nThis image demonstrates the power of **strategic simplicity in color design**. By leaning into a single bold hue paired with a neutral, it proves that impact doesn’t require complexity—instead, it lies in contrast, intention, and letting color speak for itself. Perfect for projects aiming to feel modern, trustworthy, or visually uncluttered.",

Color 1(RGB(177, 180, 191))—a muted gray-blue—anchors the palette with subtle sophistication, while Color 2(RGB(251, 255, 249)) introduces a near-luminous white, suggesting sterility or clarity. The vibrant Color 3(RGB(95, 193, 255)) and Color 4(RGB(35, 143, 231))—both shades of electric and cobalt blue—inject energy and focus, evoking digital interfaces or scientific experimentation. Color 5(RGB(54, 74, 95))—a deep slate—grounds the palette with a sense of structure and depth. The harmony is cool and calculated, with high contrast between the bright blues and the near-white, while the muted tones of Color 1 and Color 5 provide balance. The theme suggests a futuristic lab or a sleek, tech-driven environment, where clarity and innovation intersect.",

      "image_analysis": "### **Style**  \nThe image embodies a **minimalist, monochromatic design ethos**—stripped down to essential elements with deliberate simplicity. It features a single, solid blue square set against a neutral (likely white) background, prioritizing clean lines, negative space, and bold contrast. This style leans into \"less is more,\" emphasizing clarity and focus over complexity, making it versatile for modern, contemporary, or even minimalist aesthetic contexts.  \n\n\n### **Colors**  \nThe dominant color is a **rich, saturated blue**—likely a mid-to-deep shade (e.g., royal blue, cobalt, or primary blue) that commands attention without being overly bright. Its vibrancy is balanced by the neutral background (assumed white), creating high contrast that enhances readability and visual impact.  \n\n- **Blue**: Psychologically, blue is linked to trust, calmness, stability, and professionalism. Its cool undertones evoke a sense of serenity, while its saturation adds energy, striking a balance between approachability and authority.  \n- **Neutral Background**: The white (or off-white) backdrop acts as a \"blank canvas,\" amplifying the blue’s intensity and allowing it to feel grounded and intentional. It also reinforces the minimalist vibe by avoiding visual clutter.  \n\n\n### **Mood**  \nThe color palette and simplicity combine to evoke a mood of **calm confidence** and **clarity**. The saturated blue exudes reliability and poise, while the empty space around the square creates a sense of openness and tranquility. There’s an undercurrent of modernity, too—this design feels fresh, unpretentious, and purposeful, making it suitable for contexts where focus, professionalism, or a serene atmosphere is desired.  \n\n\n### **Color Design Inspiration**  \nThis palette is highly adaptable for design projects:  \n- **Branding**: Ideal for tech, finance, or wellness brands aiming to convey trust (blue) and modernity (minimalism).  \n- **Interior Design**: A bold blue accent wall or furniture piece in a white/neutral room could mirror this calm yet striking energy.  \n- **Graphic Design**: Use the blue as a focal color for logos, posters, or digital interfaces, leveraging its contrast with white for readability and impact.  \n\nIn short, the image proves that a single, well-chosen color—paired with restraint—can communicate power, calm, and sophistication.",

Together, these colors evoke a mood of quiet introspection and domestic tranquility, blending warmth with a hint of urban detachment. Color 1(RGB(255, 240, 201))—a soft, creamy off-white—suggests the glow of lamplight on walls, while Color 2(RGB(178, 177, 175)), a muted gray, grounds the palette in the mundane textures of everyday life.

Color 5(RGB(251, 251, 255)), a near-pure white, acts as a crisp, clean accent, mirroring the sterility of modern interiors. The harmony is soft and understated, with low saturation and gentle contrasts, evoking the quiet solitude of a lived-in space—a balance between coziness and isolation. The theme suggests a contemporary urban apartment, where moments of warmth (Color 1) and cool detachment (Color 3 and 4) coexist, framed by neutral tones (Color 2 and 5) that speak to minimalist design and fleeting human presence.",

      "generated_solution": "### **Classical Luxury Color Palette for a High-End Hotel Lobby**  \n\n#### **Design Concept**  \nThis palette merges **timeless elegance** with **modern minimalism**, inspired by the serene confidence of monochromatic blue and the sophistication of classical luxury. It balances deep, regal tones with warm neutrals to evoke opulence without ostentation—ideal for a high-end hotel lobby where guests should feel both awe and comfort. The palette draws from the retrieved knowledge (e.g., \"Lab - Cobalt Blue\" for crisp modernity, \"Neutral Blue Copy\" for tranquil depth) while introducing rich metallics and earthy accents to elevate the luxury quotient.  \n\n---\n\n### **Color Palette (RGB Values)**  \n1. **Royal Sapphire** – `RGB(15, 30, 64)`  \n   - A deep, jewel-toned blue that exudes authority and grandeur. Acts as the anchor, reminiscent of historic European tapestries or velvet upholstery.  \n\n2. **Gilded Champagne** – `RGB(234, 224, 200)`  \n   - A warm, creamy neutral with a subtle golden undertone. Mirrors the soft glow of candlelight on marble surfaces, providing balance to the dark blue.  \n\n3. **Antique Brass** – `RGB(194, 160, 120)`  \n   - A muted metallic with patina-like warmth. Used for accents (e.g., door handles, frames) to evoke heritage craftsmanship.  \n\n4. **Misted Slate** – `RGB(145, 155, 169)`  \n   - A cool, stone-inspired gray-blue. Functions as a transitional tone, bridging the bold sapphire and lighter neutrals while echoing minimalist design.  \n\n5. **Blackened Pearl** – `RGB(25, 25, 25)`  \n   - A near-black with a faint sheen. Adds depth to architectural details (e.g., baseboards, lighting fixtures) without overpowering.  \n\n---\n\n### **Application**  \n- **Walls & Flooring**: *Royal Sapphire* on feature walls or upholstery; *Gilded Champagne* for ceilings or limestone floors.  \n- **Furniture**: *Antique Brass* for legs/frames; *Misted Slate* in velvet or wool textiles.  \n- **Accents**: *Blackened Pearl* in ironwork or art frames; *Gilded Champagne* in lighting (chandeliers, sconces).  \n- **Harmony**: The palette’s high contrast (dark blue/light cream) ensures drama, while the metallics and mid-tones add tactile richness.  \n\n---\n\n### **Innovation**  \n1. **Layered Neutrals**: Unlike flat monochromes, this palette integrates warm (champagne, brass) and cool (slate, sapphire) neutrals for dynamic interplay.  \n2. **Material-Driven Hues**: Colors mimic tangible luxury materials (e.g., aged brass, polished stone) rather than flat pigments.  \n3. **Adaptive Lighting**: The palette shifts tone under warm/cool lighting—*Royal Sapphire* appears velvety at night, crisp by day.  \n4. **Heritage Minimalism**: Combines Baroque opulence (deep blues, golds) with minimalist restraint (clean lines, muted contrasts).  \n\nThis palette transcends trends, offering a **timeless yet contemporary** foundation for a lobby that whispers luxury rather than shouts it.",

      "image_analysis": "### **Style: Minimalist & Geometric**  \nThe image embodies a **minimalist** and **geometric** design style, characterized by extreme simplicity, clean lines, and a deliberate reduction of visual elements. The focus is on a single, unadorned square—no patterns, gradients, or decorative flourishes—framed by ample white negative space. This \"less is more\" approach prioritizes clarity and intentionality, aligning with modern design principles that value functionality and visual restraint. The geometric precision of the square (sharp corners, uniform edges) adds a sense of structure and order, making the composition feel intentional and balanced.  \n\n\n### **Colors: Saturated Blue + Crisp White**  \nThe color palette is intentionally limited and impactful:  \n- **Primary Color: Vibrant Blue** – The square is rendered in a rich, saturated blue—likely a shade like *cobalt*, *royal blue*, or *mid-tone azure*. It leans bold but not overwhelming, with enough depth to feel substantial without appearing dark or muted. Blue here is the sole \"active\" color, commanding attention as the focal point.  \n- **Negative Space: Pure White** – The surrounding white background acts as a neutral canvas, amplifying the blue square’s presence through high contrast. White adds airiness and prevents the design from feeling cluttered, emphasizing the blue’s vibrancy while creating a sense of openness.  \n\nThis two-tone palette is versatile and timeless, leveraging the psychological and visual power of blue paired with the freshness of white.  \n\n\n### **Mood: Calm, Trustworthy & Bold**  \nThe color and composition evoke a mood that balances **serenity** with **confidence**:  \n- **Calm & Soothing**: Blue is universally associated with tranquility, stability, and calmness (think of the sky or ocean). The solid, unbroken blue square feels grounding, inviting a sense of relaxation or focus.  \n- **Trustworthy & Professional**: Saturated blues (like cobalt or royal) also connote reliability, trust, and authority—qualities often leveraged in branding for finance, healthcare, or tech, where credibility matters.  \n- **Bold & Intentional**: Despite its calmness, the square’s size and saturation prevent the mood from feeling passive. The stark contrast with white makes the blue feel assertive, even \"bold,\" as if declaring, *\"This is the focus—pay",

Together, these colors evoke a vibrant yet balanced mood, blending the energy of lime with the calm depth of blue—suggesting themes of modern nature or futuristic eco-design. Color 1(RGB(141, 190, 35)), a zesty lime green, injects freshness and vitality, contrasting sharply with the cooler blues. Color 2(RGB(126, 161, 190)) softens the palette with a muted sky-blue, acting as a bridge between the bright green and deeper blues. Color 3(RGB(28, 74, 115)) and Color 4(RGB(2, 74, 166)) introduce oceanic and twilight tones, creating depth, while Color 5(RGB(2, 57, 166)) intensifies the contrast with a richer navy. The harmony lies in the complementary tension between warm (lime) and cool (blue) hues, with Color 1(RGB(141, 190, 35)) popping against the subdued blues, suggesting a dynamic yet cohesive visual narrative—ideal for themes like \"urban greenery\" or \"digital naturescapes.\"",

Together, these colors evoke a mood of stark contrast between urgency and calm—Color 1(RGB(213, 7, 31)) is a fiery, almost alarming red, injecting tension, while Color 2(RGB(120, 145, 190)) offers a muted, tranquil blue, creating a push-pull dynamic. The near-white purity of Color 3(RGB(252, 245, 255)) acts as a neutral buffer, softening the palette’s intensity. Color 4(RGB(146, 136, 130)) and Color 5(RGB(98, 91, 88)) ground the scheme in muted, earthy greys, suggesting a weathered or industrial context. The palette’s theme leans into \"urban decay with flashes of defiance\"—think graffiti on concrete or a foggy cityscape punctuated by neon. Harmony is achieved through the balancing act of warm and cool tones, while the high contrast between Color 1(RGB(213, 7, 31)) and the greys creates visual drama. The name \"grey red blue\" aptly reflects this interplay of muted neutrality and vivid emotion.",

Color 4(RGB(127, 127, 127)) introduces a neutral midpoint, acting as a balancing force, and Color 5(RGB(76, 61, 53))—a warm, smoky brown—provides grounding contrast, hinting at organic elements like weathered wood or stone. The harmony is subdued and cohesive, with low-to-moderate contrast, creating a restrained yet expressive interplay between cool and warm tones.

      "generated_solution": "### **Design Concept: \"Playful Harmony\"**  \nThis palette merges the **vibrancy** and **energy** of a children’s playground with the **minimalist** and **geometric** foundation of the image context. While the original image leans into calm, monochromatic serenity, this reinterpretation injects **joyful contrast** by pairing the bold blue with complementary brights (yellows, greens, pinks) while retaining structural clarity through crisp whites and a grounding dark tone. The result balances **fun** and **order**—ideal for a playground where creativity and safety coexist.  \n\nInspiration is drawn from:  \n- The **saturated blue** of the image (reimagined as a brighter cyan for youthful energy).  \n- The **\"blue lime\"** palette’s dynamic warm-cool contrast.  \n- The **high-contrast** interplay from **\"grey red blue\"** (but softened for child-friendliness).  \n\n---\n\n### **Color Palette**  \n1. **Electric Cyan** – `RGB(0, 200, 255)`  \n   - *Replaces the original blue* with a brighter, more playful tone. Evokes water play areas or sky-themed structures.  \n2. **Sunshine Yellow** – `RGB(255, 225, 0)`  \n   - A warm, energizing accent for slides or climbing frames. Contrasts beautifully with cyan.  \n3. **Grass Green** – `RGB(100, 225, 100)`  \n   - Softened lime (inspired by \"blue lime\") for natural balance. Ideal for flooring or planters.  \n4. **Cotton Candy Pink** – `RGB(255, 150, 200)`  \n   - A playful pop for swings or decorative elements. Adds gender-neutral whimsy.  \n5. **Graphite Gray** – `RGB(60, 60, 70)`  \n   - A subtle dark anchor (like Color 5 in \"Lab - Cobalt Blue\") for railings or typography. Ensures readability and structure.  \n\n---\n\n### **Application**  \n- **Primary Surfaces**: Use **Electric Cyan** for large play structures (e.g., jungle gyms).  \n- **Accents**: **Yellow** for slides, **Pink** for swings, **Green** for safety mats.  \n- **Neutrals**: **White** (from the image context) for walls/backgrounds; **Graphite Gray** for functional elements.  \n- **Patterns**: Combine colors in geometric shapes (circles, stripes) to align with the minimalist style.  \n\n---\n\n### **Innovation**  \n1. **Child-Centric Vibrancy**: Unlike the original serene blue/white, this palette prioritizes **stimulating diversity** while avoiding visual chaos.  \n2. **Balanced Contrast**: The cyan/yellow pairing is scientifically proven to engage children’s attention without overstimulation.  \n3. **Adaptable Minimalism**: Colors work in solid blocks (geometric simplicity) but can be mixed for creative murals.  \n4. **Inclusivity**: Avoids stereotypical \"boy/girl\" divides (e.g., pink + cyan + yellow for universal appeal).  \n\n**Professional Reference**: The graphite gray nods to \"Lab - Cobalt Blue’s\" structured depth, while the brights echo \"blue lime’s\" lively contrast—but optimized for a child’s world.  \n\n---  \n**Final Thought**: This palette is **both functional and imaginative**, transforming minimalist geometry into a canvas for play. It respects the image’s clean lines while bursting with childlike joy.",

      "image_analysis": "### **Style Analysis**  \nThe image embodies a **minimalist, geometric, and monochromatic style**. Stripped of ornamentation, it features a single, solid blue square set against a neutral (likely white or off-white) background—emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and intentionality. The stark contrast between the bold square and the empty space amplifies the power of \"less is more,\" aligning with modern, contemporary design principles that prioritize essentialism over complexity. The geometric precision of the square (clean edges, uniform shape) adds a sense of structure and order, reinforcing a sleek, purposeful aesthetic.  \n\n\n### **Color Breakdown**  \nThe dominant (and only) color is a **vibrant, saturated blue**—likely a mid-to-deep shade with strong chroma (e.g., royal blue, cobalt, or sapphire). Blue, as a primary color, carries rich symbolic weight:  \n- **Psychology**: Blue is universally associated with calmness, trust, stability, and reliability (think of oceanic serenity or institutional trustworthiness). However, its saturation here leans into energy rather than passivity—avoiding pastels or muted tones to feel bold and intentional.  \n- **Visual Impact**: The solidity of the blue (no gradients, patterns, or texture) creates a \"block\" of color that commands attention. Its opacity and uniformity make it feel grounded and present, while the contrast with the neutral background ensures it doesn’t blend in—instead, it *pops* as the focal point.  \n\n\n### **Mood Conveyed**  \nThe color and composition together evoke a mood of **quiet confidence, clarity, and purpose**. The deep blue square feels both reassuring (thanks to blue’s calming undertones) and assertive (due to its saturation and size). The empty space around it fosters a sense of openness and breathing room, preventing overwhelm and inviting focus—like a blank canvas that encourages mindfulness or contemplation. There’s also a subtle modernity to the mood: it feels fresh, uncluttered, and forward-thinking, as if designed for a space or brand that values transparency and directness.  \n\n\n### **Color Design Inspiration**  \nThis image offers rich inspiration for design across contexts:  \n\n- **Branding & Identity**: For brands aiming to project trust, stability, or innovation, a bold blue like this could serve as a core color. Its simplicity ensures",

The palette balances vibrant contrast (the red-blue clash) with moments of harmony (the muted lavender and soft pink), embodying a theme of unity amid bold change—fitting for a campaign era.

      "generated_solution": "### **Warm Cozy Living Room Color Palette**  \n\n#### **Design Concept**  \nThis palette merges the **minimalist clarity** of the image’s geometric blue with the user’s request for a **warm, cozy living room**. It balances bold intentionality (inspired by the square’s vibrancy) with earthy, inviting tones, creating a space that feels both modern and nurturing. The palette avoids stark contrasts, opting for soft transitions between warm neutrals and muted accents, evoking firelight, natural textures, and understated elegance.  \n\n---\n\n### **Color Palette**  \n1. **Anchor Stone (RGB: 230, 224, 212)**  \n   - A warm off-white with a subtle gray undertone, acting as the \"neutral background\" of the room (walls, large furniture). Inspired by the image’s empty space but warmed for coziness.  \n\n2. **Ember Glow (RGB: 210, 150, 110)**  \n   - A muted terracotta, evoking clay pottery or autumn leaves. This replaces the blue square’s \"focal point\" role but in a softer, organic form (e.g., an accent chair or throw pillows).  \n\n3. **Deep Cocoa (RGB: 90, 70, 60)**  \n   - A rich brown with a hint of charcoal, grounding the palette like the image’s geometric precision. Use for wooden furniture or shelving to add structure.  \n\n4. **Misty Rose (RGB: 235, 205, 195)**  \n   - A blush-beige, softening the palette like the \"breathing room\" around the blue square. Ideal for textiles (curtains, rugs) to diffuse warmth.  \n\n5. **Hearth Blue (RGB: 130, 155, 165)**  \n   - A dusty teal-blue, nodding to the image’s cobalt but desaturated for harmony. Acts as a subtle cool counterpoint (e.g., ceramics or artwork).  \n\n---\n\n### **Application**  \n- **Walls & Large Surfaces**: *Anchor Stone* (neutral base) + *Deep Cocoa* (trim/bookshelves).  \n- **Textiles & Soft Furnishings**: *Misty Rose* (rugs, drapes) + *Ember Glow* (accent pillows).  \n- **Focal Points**: *Hearth Blue* in small decor (vases, frames) to echo the image’s boldness without overwhelming.  \n- **Lighting**: Warm amber bulbs to enhance the earthy tones.  \n\n---\n\n### **Innovation**  \n1. **Dual Inspiration**: Bridges the gap between minimalist geometry (image) and organic warmth (user request).  \n2. **Temperature Balance**: The unexpected *Hearth Blue* prevents the palette from feeling overly rustic, adding sophistication.  \n3. **Subtle Contrasts**: Unlike the image’s stark blue/white, tones blend seamlessly for a layered, livable feel.  \n4. **Material-Driven**: Each color suggests a natural texture (stone, clay, wood, linen), enhancing tactile coziness.  \n\n**Professional Note**: This palette avoids clichéd \"farmhouse\" warmth by integrating the image’s modernist restraint, resulting in a timeless yet fresh aesthetic.  \n\n---  \nWould you like adjustments for specific materials (e.g., leather vs. fabric) or lighting conditions?",

      "image_analysis": "### **Style: Minimalist & Bold**  \nThe image embodies a **minimalist design ethos**, characterized by extreme simplicity and a focus on essential elements. There are no decorative flourishes, patterns, or gradients—just a solid, unadorned blue square set against a clean white background. This stripped-back approach prioritizes the power of color and form, making the blue square the sole focal point. The geometric precision of the square (sharp edges, uniform dimensions) adds a sense of structure and intentionality, reinforcing a modern, no-nonsense aesthetic.  \n\n\n### **Colors: Vibrant Blue + Crisp White**  \nThe color palette is intentionally limited but impactful:  \n- **Primary Color: Blue** – The square is rendered in a rich, saturated blue. While the exact shade isn’t specified, blue here reads as bold yet balanced—likely a mid-to-deep tone (e.g., royal blue, cobalt, or navy) that avoids being overly bright or muted. Blue is inherently versatile, evoking both calmness and confidence.  \n- **Neutral Background: White** – The stark white backdrop acts as a \"negative space\" that amplifies the blue square. It creates crisp contrast, making the blue appear more vivid and ensuring the eye is immediately drawn to the shape. White also adds airiness, preventing the design from feeling heavy.  \n\nTogether, the blue-white pairing is timeless and universally appealing. The high contrast between the saturated blue and pure white enhances readability and visual impact, a key lesson for color inspiration: *simplifying to two colors can create maximum effect*.  \n\n\n### **Mood: Calm, Confident, & Modern**  \nThe color and style combine to evoke a mood that is **serene yet assertive**.  \n- **Calmness**: Blue is psychologically linked to tranquility, trust, and stability—think of the sky or ocean. Its presence here creates a sense of calm, making the image feel approachable and grounded.  \n- **Confidence**: The bold saturation of the blue square and its unapologetic size (dominating the frame) convey confidence and clarity. There’s no ambiguity; this color choice feels intentional and self-assured.  \n- **Modernity**: The pairing of vibrant blue with white is inherently contemporary, aligning with trends in minimalist branding, digital interfaces, and graphic design. It feels fresh, uncluttered, and forward-thinking,",

The vibrant Color 3(RGB(95, 193, 255)) and Color 4(RGB(35, 143, 231))—both shades of electric and cobalt blue—inject energy and focus, evoking digital interfaces or scientific experimentation. Color 5(RGB(54, 74, 95))—a deep slate—grounds the palette with a sense of structure and depth. The harmony is cool and calculated, with high contrast between the bright blues and the near-white, while the muted tones of Color 1 and Color 5 provide balance. The theme suggests a futuristic lab or a sleek, tech-driven environment, where clarity and innovation intersect.",

          "description": "This palette, titled \"No blue,\" consists of Color 1(RGB(56, 63, 83)), Color 2(RGB(65, 116, 124)), Color 3(RGB(118, 133, 153)), Color 4(RGB(144, 217, 205)), and Color 5(RGB(212, 245, 255)). Despite its name, the palette subtly embraces cool, muted tones with a paradoxical blue undertone, evoking a mood of quiet introspection and restrained modernity. Color 1(RGB(56, 63, 83)) anchors the palette with a deep, slate-like neutrality, while Color 2(RGB(65, 116, 124)) and Color 3(RGB(118, 133, 153)) introduce muted teal and grayish-blue hues, suggesting themes of industrial minimalism or a foggy coastal dawn. Color 4(RGB(144, 217, 205)) disrupts the somberness with a fresh, icy mint, injecting a whisper of vitality, and Color 5(RGB(212, 245, 255))—the lightest and most ethereal—acts as a luminous veil, softening the palette’s contrast. The harmony is cool and cohesive, with low saturation and gentle transitions, yet the interplay between the darker tones (Color 1 and Color 3) and the brighter accents (Color 4 and Color 5) creates a subtle tension, like sunlight filtering through dense mist. The name \"No blue\" ironically highlights the palette’s reliance on blue-adjacent tones, subverting expectations with a quiet, almost melancholic sophistication.",

      "generated_solution": "### **Energetic Vibrant Color Palette for Creative Studio**  \n\n#### **Design Concept: \"Dynamic Clarity\"**  \nThis palette merges the **bold minimalism** of the reference image (vibrant blue + crisp white) with an **energetic, creative twist**, tailored for a studio environment. It retains the confidence and modernity of the original but amplifies vibrancy through strategic pops of complementary hues. The philosophy is *\"simplicity with surprise\"*—using a clean foundation (white + dominant blue) alongside unexpected accents (electric teal, warm coral) to stimulate creativity without overwhelming.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Color Palette (5 RGB Colors)**  \n\n1. **Primary Blue – RGB(35, 143, 231)**  \n   - *Cobalt-inspired anchor*: A saturated, mid-tone blue that balances energy and trust. It’s the studio’s signature hue, evoking professionalism and dynamism.  \n\n2. **Luminous White – RGB(251, 255, 249)**  \n   - *Near-neutral backdrop*: A whisper-cool white to amplify contrast and maintain airiness. Slightly off-pure to reduce glare in physical/digital spaces.  \n\n3. **Electric Teal – RGB(95, 255, 193)**  \n   - *Vibrant accent*: A futuristic, high-energy teal (inspired by \"Lab - Cobalt Blue\") for call-to-actions or creative highlights. Adds a playful, innovative edge.  \n\n4. **Coral Spark – RGB(255, 159, 159)**  \n   - *Warm counterpoint*: A soft coral (nod to \"Obama 08\") to humanize the palette. Used sparingly for social spaces or collaborative zones.  \n\n5. **Deep Slate – RGB(54, 74, 95)**  \n   - *Grounding contrast*: A dark blue-gray (from \"Lab - Cobalt Blue\") for typography or structural elements. Adds depth without heaviness.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Application**  \n- **Primary Blue + White**: Dominant for walls, logos, and digital interfaces (e.g., studio website).  \n- **Electric Teal**: Accent walls, button highlights, or interactive tools.  \n- **Coral Spark**: Breakout furniture, event graphics, or motivational signage.  \n- **Deep Slate**: Text, frames, or architectural details to anchor the vibrancy.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Innovation**  \n1. **Controlled Energy**: Unlike generic vibrant palettes, this uses *contrast hierarchy*—bold blue as the hero, teal/coral as strategic accents—to avoid visual chaos.  \n2. **Psychological Balance**: Blue fosters focus, teal sparks creativity, and coral adds warmth, aligning with studio workflows.  \n3. **Adaptable Minimalism**: Works in 2-color (blue + white) or full 5-color modes, scalable from branding to interior design.  \n\n**Why It Stands Out**: It’s a minimalist palette *with a pulse*, blending professionalism (blue/white) with creative rebellion (teal/coral)—perfect for a studio that values both precision and imagination.  \n\n---  \n**Final Palette**:  \n[[35, 143, 231], [251, 255, 249], [95, 255, 193], [255, 159, 159], [54, 74, 95]]",
